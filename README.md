Etch-a-Sketch

Etch-a-Sketch Project

Final thoughts:

A complete different project compared to RPS.

RPS included things like selections and 3 different choices, but this project worked with things like numbers and grids.

The most difficult part of this project was the implemention of the user input to create a new grid.

I did try using a button to prompt for user input however it just did not work at all.

Through some research, I found that you can use a HTML input element to get user inputs so I tried that instead.

That worked amazingly so I'm pretty happy with that.
